    <h1>Nemisis, Resident Evil Character</h1>
    <p>
    The Nemesis, also called the Nemesis-T Type, the Pursuer[3] or the Chaser (追跡者, Tsuisekisha),[4][5] is a fictional character in Capcom's Resident Evil franchise. 
    Although smaller than other Tyrant models, the creature dwarfs a typical human, and possesses vastly superior intelligence and physical dexterity to its undead peers.
