        Netflix’s Spanish heist action-drama series ‘Money Heist’ tells the story of a group of extraordinary criminals who initially gather together for a heist on the Royal Mint of Spain.
        Their leader is a brilliant and enigmatic man known simply as the Professor (Álvaro Morte). 
        He has spent years meticulously planning the heist, predicting every possible scenario, and coming up with solutions for all of them. 
        And even when an unforeseen incident happens during the heist, he is quick-witted enough to reshape his plans to accommodate the new development.
